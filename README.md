One has to prepare MATLAB with an appropriate version, YALMIP, and some SDP solver (e.g., SDPT3 and SeDuMi).
Simulation results and figures under the same setting as the above paper can be generated by running 'sim_for_manuscript.m'.
If one wants to run a single simulation, run 'parameters.m' and 'test.m' in turn.
