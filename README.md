This repository presents the simulation codes for the numearical experiments in the following paper:

with a class of non-block-diagonal Lyapunov functions,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.04576, 2024.

One has to prepare MATLAB with an appropriate version, YALMIP, and some SDP solver (e.g., SDPT3 and SeDuMi).
Simulation results and figures under the same setting as the above paper can be generated by running `sim_for_manuscript.m`.
If one wants to conduct a single simulation, run `parameters.m` and `test.m` in turn.

Acknowledgement: several codes (`enerate_SXlessS.m` and `Hinfty_SI.m`) are based on the paper (Sparsity Invariance for Convex Design of Distributed Controllers, by by Luca Furieri, Yang Zheng, Antonis Papachristodoulou, Maryam Kamgarpour, IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems, 2020) and the repository (https://github.com/FurieriLuca/Sparsity-Invariance).
